# Fancy page filled with original colors

Using React.js I created simple page with quite nice animations and a little bit less aesthetic views. Whole project is created only with function's components (so hooks appear too!) and routing on this page is made by React Router. All animations are powered by GSAP library and astonishing form works thanks to smtpJS.
